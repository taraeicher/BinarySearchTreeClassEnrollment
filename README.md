A binary search tree manages data for students who have enrolled in in a course. Students
are alphabetically ordered in the tree by last name and for last names which are the same, further ordered by
first-name-followed-by-middle-name. The tree does not contain duplicates.
This program adds students in the enrollment_list file and removes students in the drop_list file. The resulting class list is saved in a file called classlist.txt.
